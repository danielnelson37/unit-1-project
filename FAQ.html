            <p> Access to abortion care has been a fundamental part of reproductive care for Black, Brown, and low-income people throughout the country. The legalization of abortion in the 1970s, following Roe v. Wade, led to a 9.6% increase in Black women’s college graduation rate, according to a study by the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. Abortion access also resulted in a 6.9% increase in Black women’s labor market participation rate. This was three times higher than the corresponding rate for women generally.
              Overturning reproductive rights would disproportionately harm Black, Brown, and low-income people who are most impacted by systemic inequalities. A recent study estimated that banning abortion in the U.S. would lead to a 21% increase in the number of pregnancy-related deaths overall and a 33% increase among Black people, simply because staying pregnant is more dangerous than having an abortion. It would also lead to increased deaths due to unsafe abortions or attempted abortions.</p>

              Fewer Black and Latino women in America have health insurance, especially in states with tight abortion restrictions, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. For example, in Texas, Mississippi, and Georgia, at least 16 percent of Black women and 36 percent of Latinas were uninsured in 2019, some of the highest such rates in the country.</p>

            <p>In Roe v. Wade (1973), the Supreme Court established that under the Fourteenth Amendment, which protects a person’s liberty interest against state deprivation without due process of law, a person has a right to choose to have an abortion before viability — that is, before approximately 24 weeks into a pregnancy. The Court concluded that when a pregnancy reached viability, state interests in the life of the fetus are high enough to permit states to prohibit abortions.
              This decision meant that states did not have the right to ban abortion. Since then, states have passed more than 1,300 laws and restrictions that make it harder and more expensive to get an abortion.</p>
